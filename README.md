# jokester
A fun or at times dark joke site.
I have used Joke API(https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/) to make this project.  To be honest it was quite a hard task for me as I have just learned Promises and async await. 

Technology used : HTML, CSS, JavaScipt.
Concept used : Promises, DOM manipualtion and async await.

UI in different screen size:
